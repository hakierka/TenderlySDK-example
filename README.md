# Tenderly Simulation Example


This repository provides a basic example of how to use Tenderly SDK to simulate transactions. It demonstrates the usage of Tenderly simulations integrated into decentralized applications.

## Examples

- [basic-simulation.js](examples/basic-simulation.js): Code for running a basic transaction simulation using Tenderly SDK.

For more information on Tenderly SDK and simulations, refer to the [Tenderly SDK documentation](https://docs.tenderly.co/tenderly-sdk/tutorials-and-quickstarts/how-to-simulate-transactions-with-tenderly-sdk).

## Usage

To run the basic simulation example:

1. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tenderly-Simulation-Example.git`
3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
`cd Tenderly-Simulation-Example`
4. Install the required dependencies:
`npm install @tenderly/sdk`
5. Open the `examples/basic-simulation.js` file and replace the placeholder values in the `tenderly` configuration object with your actual Tenderly account information.
6. Run the simulation:
`node examples/basic-simulation.js`


Please note that you need to have a valid Tenderly account and obtain the necessary account details to run the simulations successfully.

For more information and detailed tutorials, refer to the [Tenderly documentation](https://docs.tenderly.co/).
